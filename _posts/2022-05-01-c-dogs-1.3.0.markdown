Happy May Day! Today we have another release with a random assortment of fixes and enhancements!

Since around version 1.0, the campaign editor was missing some UI elements, like mission objectives, objects, enemies, and allowed weapons ðŸ™ƒ Pretty important no? Well they're fixed now...

Also, we have a bunch of unrelated enhancements:
