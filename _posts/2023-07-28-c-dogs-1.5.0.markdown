It's a C-Dogs SDL release! With one minor feature: **customize hats, hair, facial hair and glasses**!

Plus a big bunch of fixes and enhancements! Thanks to [@Kurtsley](https://github.com/Kurtsley), [@PavanLuca](https://github.com/PavanLuca) and [@reinerh](https://github.com/reinerh) for fixing/raising them üí™

And finally, a controversial feature removal: **quickplay**!

Quickplay was a mode that was added way way back in version 0.5.2. It let players jump into a randomly generated level and start running and gunning, without having to choose a campaign. It was slightly improved over the years but the premise stayed the same: get started quickly and shoot up some bad guys.

However lots of players new to C-Dogs would pick this mode first, and walk away unimpressed by the game, thinking it's just a simple shooting game. But with dozens of high quality campaigns, mods, even the ability to play Wolfenstein 3D and Spear of Destiny, this was a highly inaccurate impression!

Therefore I've made the decision to hide the feature entirely - you can't play it unless you re-enable it via the source code. I could consider adding it back if enough people ask me to, or if we can greatly improve its quality.
