Cyberdogs is a freeware DOS run-and-gun shooter by Ronny Wester, released in 1994. If that sounds familiar, that's because it's the prequel to C-Dogs! The two games look alike but actually play very different - in Cyberdogs you can earn money and buy and sell weapons between levels, and the gameplay is a lot more tense. There are many folks who prefer Cyberdogs to C-Dogs as a result.

With this release, we've added Cyberdogs as a campaign in C-Dogs SDL, so you can enjoy this classic oldie but goodie, but with all the modern C-Dogs SDL enhancements (wanna try 4 player co-op?) It's no exaggeration to say this feature was [10 years in the making](https://github.com/cxong/cdogs-sdl/issues/71)! In order to implement Cyberdogs, a lot of major features had to be made - buy/sell weapons, a revamped equip menu showing prices and ammo, new pickup types like over-healing and extra lives, enemies that can both shoot and melee, and many many more - not to mention lots of reverse engineering and tweaking gameplay so it feels the same. Some of the features have trickled out to other parts of C-Dogs SDL, for example the Wolf3D extra life pickups now actually give you an extra life ðŸ˜†

Last but not least this release contains a bunch of fixes and enhancements made possible by awesome contributors, special thanks to [**reinerh**](https://github.com/reinerh) for miscellaneous fixes and helping to get [C-Dogs SDL into debian](https://packages.debian.org/sid/cdogs-sdl)! Big thanks to all who made it happen. Also thanks to [@PavanLuca](https://github.com/PavanLuca), [@naddoska](https://github.com/naddoska), [@rootkea](https://github.com/rootkea) and [@hucarxiao](https://github.com/hucarxiao) for various contributions; it's great to see that C-Dogs SDL is going slowly but strongly, so keep those patches and bug reports coming in!
