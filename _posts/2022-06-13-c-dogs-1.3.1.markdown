Small bugfix release, with a few minor enhancements:

- Fix gas bomb poison effect lasting forever ðŸ˜±
- Add accurate 1up powerup for Wolf3D/SoD campaigns (1 life, 100 health, 25 ammo)
- Add accurate backpack powerup for Doom campaign (small amounts of all ammo types)
- Persistent lives

The last one is a notable change; previously lives would reset every level, making it little more than a glorified extended life meter. Now it makes sense to try to stay alive and not waste lives, and collect those 1up powerups (in Wolf3D/SoD)!
